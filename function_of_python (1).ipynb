        "3. Simple collections of data: If you're storing a simple, ordered collection of items (such as numbers, strings, or other objects) where each element is not uniquely identied by a key, a list is often a more natural choice. For instance, a list of names, numbers, or points.\n",

This can be useful if you need to preserve the order without needing a separate data structure like a list.
